We follow Schr¨odinger’s original idea and go beyond this analogy by changing over from the Hamilton’s principal function S to the wavefunction . We thus travel from classical to quantum mechanics using optics as a guide. Unfortunately, and despite its mathematical beauty and simplicity, the connection between classical and quantum mechanics through optics is nowadays hardly known and mostly ignored in university education. The present work tries to ﬁll this gap.},

Goldstein: ``"Is the Hamilton-Jacobi equation the short wavelength limit of the Schrödinger equation?" But, before that, we will identify an essential element that will take us from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation to the dynamic equation of non-relativistic quantum mechanics for a function ψ through an exact procedure. This element is the linear independence of the functions ψ and ψ* (their complex conjugate). Their independence is demonstrated for physical systems where the acting physical potential does not explicitly depend on time. Proceeding in reverse, from the Schrödinger equation, we obtain the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, exactly, without additional terms.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03689},
	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2410.03689},
	abstract = {Most authors of textbooks on quantum mechanics either postulate or sketch a short `ad hoc` derivation of Schrodinger's equation. In this work we give a detailed derivation of Schrodinger's equation from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and the Eikonal equation in geometrical optics. We start from the historical debates on the nature of light -- whether it is a beam of particles, or waves in the aether. We derive the Eikonal equation and show the conditions when a wave can behave as a beam of particles. Then we discuss several experiments with an electron gun, that show clearly diffraction and interference of a single electron. Next, in order to explain these experiments, we derive Schrodinger's equation by comparing Hamilton-Jacobi equation in classical mechanics with the Eikonal equation in geometrical optics. To do that, we first show how to derive the wave equation from the Eikonal equation (not the other way around!). Second, we use this method to derive Schrodinger's equation from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Next, we derive Born's statistical rule using the early understanding of de Broglie that both particles and waves exist. Afterwards, we show that historically people preferred to remove the particles (as well as their trajectories) altogether from de Broglie's ideas but retained Born's rule (the so called Copenhagen interpretation). These derivations of the foundations of quantum mechanics do not follow precisely the history of the subject. Rather we select some early ideas and experiments in a judicious manner to present Schrodinger's equation in a logical and ordered way. We use the electron gun experiments instead of black body radiation and photoelectric effect. Our derivation may bring more light and satisfaction for the undergraduate students about the confusing and rather mysterious subject of quantum mechanics.},
