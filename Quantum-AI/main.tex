\begin{abstract}
This document details the systematic construction of a Complete Set of Commuting
Observables (CSCO) for a quantum system in a four-dimensional Hilbert space,
$\mathcal{H}$. Starting from a deliberately constructed degenerate observable
$A$, we introduce subsequent commuting observables $B$ and $C$ to sequentially
lift the degeneracies. We analyse the process of measurement, including the
calculation of probabilities, state collapse, and the algebraic construction of
projection operators using both spectral decomposition and the minimal
polynomial method.
\end{abstract}

\section{Problem Statement and First Observable \texorpdfstring{$A$}{A}}

We consider a quantum system described by a state vector in a Hilbert space
$\mathcal{H}$. The initial information about the system is provided by an
observable $A$ which possesses a degenerate spectrum. Our goal is to find a set
of additional observables that commute with $A$ and each other, such that their
collective set of eigenvalues uniquely specifies any basis vector of
$\mathcal{H}$.

\subsection{Constraints and Construction of Operator \texorpdfstring{$A$}{A}}
The primary observable $A$ is a self-adjoint operator, $A: \mathcal{H} \to
\mathcal{H}$, subject to the following constraints:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $A$ is diagonal in the computational basis $\{\ket{1}, \ket{2}, \ket{3},
    \dots\}$.
  \item The spectrum of $A$, $\sigma(A)$, contains exactly two distinct real
    eigenvalues, $\alpha \neq \beta$.
  \item One eigenspace, $V_\alpha$, corresponding to eigenvalue $\alpha$, is
    three-dimensional: $\dim(V_\alpha) = 3$.
  \item The total dimension of the Hilbert space is minimal, but no greater than
    4.
\end{itemize}
The spectral theorem dictates that $\mathcal{H}$ is the orthogonal direct sum of
the eigenspaces of $A$, so $\dim(\mathcal{H}) = \dim(V_\alpha) + \dim(V_\beta)$.
Given $\dim(V_\alpha) = 3$ and the requirement that $\dim(V_\beta) \ge 1$, the
constraint $\dim(\mathcal{H}) \le 4$ uniquely determines that $\dim(V_\beta) =
1$ and $\dim(\mathcal{H}) = 4$. Our Hilbert space is thus isomorphic to
$\mathbb{C}^4$.

We adopt the standard orthonormal computational basis $\{\ket{1}, \ket{2},
\ket{3}, \ket{4}\}$. Since $A$ must be diagonal in this basis, these basis
vectors are its eigenvectors. To satisfy the dimensionality constraints, we
assign three of them to the eigenvalue $\alpha$ and one to $\beta$. A canonical
matrix representation for $A$ is:
$$
A \mapsto \mathbf{A} =
\begin{pmatrix}
  \alpha & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & \alpha & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & \alpha & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & \beta
\end{pmatrix}
$$
The eigenspaces are therefore $V_\alpha = \text{span}\{\ket{1}, \ket{2},
\ket{3}\}$ and $V_\beta = \text{span}\{\ket{4}\}$.

\section{Measurement Formalism for Operator \texorpdfstring{$A$}{A}}

To analyse a measurement, we consider a general state $\ket{\psi} \in
\mathcal{H}$ prepared in a basis that is incompatible with the eigenbasis of
$A$.

\subsection{A General State in a Superposition Basis}

Let us define a new orthonormal basis, the $V$-basis, denoted by $\{\ket{v_i}\}_{i=1}^4$:
\begin{align*}
  \ket{v_1} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{1} + \ket{2}) & \ket{v_3} &=
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{3} + \ket{4}) \\
  \ket{v_2} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{1} - \ket{2}) & \ket{v_4} &=
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{3} - \ket{4})
\end{align*}
An arbitrary normalized state $\ket{\psi}$ can be expressed as a superposition
in this basis:
$$
\ket{\psi} = \sum_{i=1}^{4} c_i \ket{v_i}, \quad \text{with} \quad
\sum_{i=1}^{4} |c_i|^2 = 1
$$
To analyse the measurement of $A$, we must express $\ket{\psi}$ in the
computational basis (the eigenbasis of $A$). This is a change of basis:
\begin{align*}
  \ket{\psi} &= c_1 \qty( \frac{\ket{1} + \ket{2}}{\sqrt{2}} ) + c_2 \qty(
    \frac{\ket{1} - \ket{2}}{\sqrt{2}} ) + c_3 \qty( \frac{\ket{3} +
    \ket{4}}{\sqrt{2}} ) + c_4 \qty( \frac{\ket{3} - \ket{4}}{\sqrt{2}} ) \\
             &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \qty[ (c_1+c_2)\ket{1} + (c_1-c_2)\ket{2} +
             (c_3+c_4)\ket{3} + (c_3-c_4)\ket{4} ]
\end{align*}
The column vector representation of $\ket{\psi}$ in the computational basis is:
$$
\ket{\psi} \mapsto \boldsymbol{\psi}_{A} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\begin{pmatrix}
  c_1 + c_2 \\
  c_1 - c_2 \\
  c_3 + c_4 \\
  c_3 - c_4
\end{pmatrix}
$$
This transformation is mediated by a unitary matrix $U$ whose columns are the
basis vectors $\ket{v_i}$ expressed in the computational basis, such that
$\boldsymbol{\psi}_A = U \boldsymbol{\psi}_V$.

\subsection{Projection Operators and Probabilities}

The measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues of $A$. The probability of
measuring a particular eigenvalue is found using projection operators. The
projectors onto the eigenspaces $V_\alpha$ and $V_\beta$ are:
$$
P_\alpha = \dyad{1}{1} + \dyad{2}{2} + \dyad{3}{3} \quad \text{and} \quad
P_\beta = \dyad{4}{4}
$$
The probability $P(\lambda)$ of measuring eigenvalue $\lambda$ for a system in
state $\ket{\psi}$ is $P(\lambda) = \norm{P_\lambda \ket{\psi}}^2 = \bra{\psi}
P_\lambda \ket{\psi}$.

\paragraph{Probability of measuring $\alpha$:}
The projection of $\ket{\psi}$ onto $V_\alpha$ is $P_\alpha \ket{\psi} =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} [ (c_1+c_2)\ket{1} + (c_1-c_2)\ket{2} + (c_3+c_4)\ket{3} ]$.
\begin{align*}
  P(\alpha) &= \norm{P_\alpha \ket{\psi}}^2 = \frac{1}{2} \qty( |c_1+c_2|^2 +
    |c_1-c_2|^2 + |c_3+c_4|^2 ) \\
            &= \frac{1}{2} \qty[ 2(|c_1|^2 + |c_2|^2) + |c_3+c_4|^2 ] = |c_1|^2
              + |c_2|^2 + \frac{1}{2}|c_3+c_4|^2
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Probability of measuring $\beta$:}
The projection of $\ket{\psi}$ onto $V_\beta$ is $P_\beta \ket{\psi} =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (c_3-c_4)\ket{4}$.
$$
P(\beta) = \norm{P_\beta \ket{\psi}}^2 = \frac{1}{2} |c_3-c_4|^2
$$
As required, $P(\alpha) + P(\beta) = \sum |c_i|^2 = 1$.

\subsection{Post-Measurement States and Expectation Value}
Upon measurement, the state collapses to the normalized projection onto the
corresponding eigenspace.
\begin{itemize}
  \item If the outcome is $\alpha$, the state becomes $\ket{\psi'}_\alpha =
    \frac{P_\alpha \ket{\psi}}{\norm{P_\alpha \ket{\psi}}}$. The state is now
    confined to the 3D subspace $V_\alpha$, but is not fully determined.
  \item If the outcome is $\beta$, the state becomes $\ket{\psi'}_\beta =
    \frac{P_\beta \ket{\psi}}{\norm{P_\beta \ket{\psi}}} = e^{i\phi}\ket{4}$,
    which is a uniquely determined state (up to a global phase).
\end{itemize}
The expectation value of $A$ is given by $\expval{A}{\psi} = \alpha P(\alpha) +
\beta P(\beta)$.

\subsection{Algebraic Construction of Projectors}
An elegant and powerful method to construct projectors utilizes the functional
calculus of operators. Since $A$ is diagonalizable, its minimal polynomial is
$m(\lambda) = (\lambda-\alpha)(\lambda-\beta)$. The projector $P_\alpha$ can be
expressed as a polynomial in $A$, namely the Lagrange interpolating polynomial
$q_\alpha(\lambda)$ that satisfies $q_\alpha(\alpha)=1$ and
$q_\alpha(\beta)=0$.
$$
q_\alpha(\lambda) = \frac{\lambda - \beta}{\alpha - \beta} \implies P_\alpha =
\frac{A - \beta I}{\alpha - \beta}
$$
This algebraic formula yields the exact same matrix operator as the geometric
construction via sum of dyads, providing a crucial consistency check.

\section{Lifting the Degeneracy: Operator \texorpdfstring{$B$}{B}}

The 3-fold degeneracy of eigenvalue $\alpha$ implies $A$ is not a complete
observable. We introduce a second observable $B$ to partially lift this
degeneracy. For $A$ and $B$ to be simultaneously measurable, they must commute:
$[A,B]=0$. This condition implies that $B$ must be block-diagonal with respect
to the eigenspace decomposition of $A$.

\subsection{Construction of Operator \texorpdfstring{$B$}{B}}
We design $B$ to act non-trivially on $V_\alpha$ and to possess its own
degenerate spectrum. Within $V_\alpha$, let $B$ have two eigenvalues: $\gamma$
(2-fold degenerate) and $\delta$ (non-degenerate), with $\gamma \neq \delta$.
The eigenspaces of $B$ within $V_\alpha$ are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $W_\gamma = \text{span}\{\ket{b_1}, \ket{b_2}\}$ for eigenvalue $\gamma$.
  \item $W_\delta = \text{span}\{\ket{b_3}\}$ for eigenvalue $\delta$.
\end{itemize}
To make $B$ non-diagonal in the computational basis, we choose an orthonormal
basis for these eigenspaces that mixes $\{\ket{1}, \ket{2}, \ket{3}\}$:
$$
\ket{b_1} = \ket{3}, \quad \ket{b_2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{1}+\ket{2}),
\quad \ket{b_3} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{1}-\ket{2})
$$
The action of $B$ restricted to $V_\alpha$ is $B_\alpha = \gamma(\dyad{b_1}{b_1}
+ \dyad{b_2}{b_2}) + \delta\dyad{b_3}{b_3}$. To complete the definition of $B$
on $\mathcal{H}$, we define its action on $V_\beta=\text{span}\{\ket{4}\}$, for
instance by assigning it the eigenvalue $\delta$. The full matrix for $B$ in the
computational basis is:
$$
\mathbf{B} = \begin{pmatrix}
  \frac{\gamma+\delta}{2} & \frac{\gamma-\delta}{2} & 0 & 0 \\
  \frac{\gamma-\delta}{2} & \frac{\gamma+\delta}{2} & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & \gamma & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & \delta
\end{pmatrix}
$$
By construction, $[A,B]=0$.

\subsection{Sequential Measurement of \texorpdfstring{$B$}{B}}
Suppose a measurement of $A$ yields the outcome $\alpha$. The system is now in
the state $\ket{\psi'}_\alpha$. We now measure $B$. The possible outcomes are
$\gamma$ and $\delta$. The conditional probability is calculated as:
$$
P(\gamma|\alpha) = \norm{P_\gamma \ket{\psi'}_\alpha}^2 = \bra{\psi'}_\alpha
P_\gamma \ket{\psi'}_\alpha
$$
where $P_\gamma$ is the projector onto the eigenspace $W_\gamma$. From its basis
vectors, $P_\gamma = \dyad{b_1}{b_1} + \dyad{b_2}{b_2}$.
It is often simpler to work with the unnormalized post-A-measurement state,
$\ket{\phi_A} = P_\alpha\ket{\psi}$. The conditional probability is then:
$$
P(\gamma|\alpha) = \frac{\norm{P_\gamma \ket{\phi_A}}^2}{\norm{\ket{\phi_A}}^2}
= \frac{|c_1|^2 + \frac{1}{2}|c_3+c_4|^2}{|c_1|^2 + |c_2|^2 +
\frac{1}{2}|c_3+c_4|^2}
$$
And similarly for the outcome $\delta$, with projector $P_\delta = \dyad{b_3}{b_3}$:
$$
P(\delta|\alpha) = \frac{\norm{P_\delta \ket{\phi_A}}^2}{\norm{\ket{\phi_A}}^2}
= \frac{|c_2|^2}{|c_1|^2 + |c_2|^2 + \frac{1}{2}|c_3+c_4|^2}
$$
If the outcome is $(\alpha, \delta)$, the state collapses to $\ket{b_3}$, which
is uniquely specified. However, if the outcome is $(\alpha, \gamma)$, the state
collapses into the 2D subspace $W_\gamma$, indicating a remaining degeneracy.

\section{Completing the Set: Operator \texorpdfstring{$C$}{C}}
To lift the final degeneracy, we introduce a third operator $C$ that commutes
with both $A$ and $B$. This requires that $C$ respects the simultaneous
eigenspace decomposition of $\{A,B\}$. The only remaining degenerate eigenspace
is $W_{\alpha,\gamma} \equiv W_\gamma$.

\subsection{Construction of Operator \texorpdfstring{$C$}{C}}
We define $C$ to act non-trivially only within $W_\gamma$. Let its eigenvalues
be $\lambda_1 \neq \lambda_2$. Its eigenvectors, $\{\ket{c_1}, \ket{c_2}\}$,
must form an orthonormal basis for $W_\gamma$. We choose:
\begin{align*}
  \ket{c_1} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{b_1} + \ket{b_2}) =
  \frac{1}{2}(\ket{1}+\ket{2}) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{3} \\
  \ket{c_2} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{b_1} - \ket{b_2}) =
  -\frac{1}{2}(\ket{1}+\ket{2}) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{3}
\end{align*}
We define the action of $C$ to be zero on all other simultaneous eigenspaces.
The spectral decomposition is $C = \lambda_1 \dyad{c_1}{c_1} + \lambda_2
\dyad{c_2}{c_2}$. This guarantees $[C,A]=[C,B]=0$.

\subsection{Matrix Representation of \texorpdfstring{$C$}{C}}
To find the matrix $\mathbf{C}$ in the computational basis, we compute the dyads:
\begin{align*}
  \dyad{c_1}{c_1} &=
  \frac{1}{4}\qty(\dyad{1}{1}+\dyad{1}{2}+\dyad{2}{1}+\dyad{2}{2}) +
  \frac{1}{2}\dyad{3}{3} +
  \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}\qty(\dyad{1}{3}+\dyad{3}{1}+\dyad{2}{3}+\dyad{3}{2}) \\
  \dyad{c_2}{c_2} &=
  \frac{1}{4}\qty(\dyad{1}{1}+\dyad{1}{2}+\dyad{2}{1}+\dyad{2}{2}) +
  \frac{1}{2}\dyad{3}{3} -
  \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}\qty(\dyad{1}{3}+\dyad{3}{1}+\dyad{2}{3}+\dyad{3}{2})
\end{align*}
Combining these gives the matrix for $C$:
$$
\mathbf{C} = \frac{1}{4}
\begin{pmatrix}
  \lambda_1+\lambda_2 & \lambda_1+\lambda_2 & \sqrt{2}(\lambda_1-\lambda_2) & 0
  \\
  \lambda_1+\lambda_2 & \lambda_1+\lambda_2 & \sqrt{2}(\lambda_1-\lambda_2) & 0
  \\
  \sqrt{2}(\lambda_1-\lambda_2) & \sqrt{2}(\lambda_1-\lambda_2) &
  2(\lambda_1+\lambda_2) & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
$$

\subsection{Final Measurement Probabilities}
Suppose the measurement sequence has yielded outcomes $(\alpha, \gamma)$. The
unnormalized state is $\ket{\phi_{AB}} = P_\gamma P_\alpha \ket{\psi} =
c_1\ket{b_2} + \frac{c_3+c_4}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{b_1}$.
We now measure $C$. The probability of obtaining $\lambda_1$ is
$P(\lambda_1|\alpha, \gamma) =
\frac{|\braket{c_1}{\phi_{AB}}|^2}{\norm{\ket{\phi_{AB}}}^2}$.
The required inner product is $\braket{c_1}{\phi_{AB}} =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\qty(c_1 + \frac{c_3+c_4}{\sqrt{2}})$.
The probability is:
$$
P(\lambda_1|\alpha, \gamma) = \frac{\frac{1}{2}\abs{c_1 +
\frac{c_3+c_4}{\sqrt{2}}}^2}{|c_1|^2 + \frac{1}{2}|c_3+c_4|^2}
$$
And for $\lambda_2$:
$$
P(\lambda_2|\alpha, \gamma) = \frac{\frac{1}{2}\abs{-c_1 +
\frac{c_3+c_4}{\sqrt{2}}}^2}{|c_1|^2 + \frac{1}{2}|c_3+c_4|^2}
$$
These probabilities sum to 1. After this final measurement, the state collapses
to either $\ket{c_1}$ or $\ket{c_2}$, and the state of the system is now
uniquely determined.

\section{Conclusion: The Complete Set of Commuting Observables}
The set of operators $\{A, B, C\}$ forms a CSCO. Their simultaneous eigenvectors
form a complete orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. Each
basis vector is uniquely specified by a triplet of eigenvalues $(a,b,c)$. The
complete basis and corresponding eigenvalues are summarized below:

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c|c|ccc}
    \hline\hline
    \textbf{Basis Vector} & \textbf{Definition in Computational Basis} &
    \multicolumn{3}{c}{\textbf{Eigenvalues}} \\
                          & & $A$ & $B$ & $C$ \\
                          \hline
    $\ket{c_1}$ & $\frac{1}{2}(\ket{1}+\ket{2}) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{3}$ & $\alpha$ & $\gamma$ & $\lambda_1$ \\
    $\ket{c_2}$ & $-\frac{1}{2}(\ket{1}+\ket{2}) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{3}$ & $\alpha$ & $\gamma$ & $\lambda_2$ \\
    $\ket{b_3}$ & $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{1}-\ket{2})$ & $\alpha$ & $\delta$ & $0$ \\
    $\ket{4}$ & $\ket{4}$ & $\beta$ & $\delta$ & $0$ \\
    \hline\hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{The CSCO basis and their corresponding eigenvalues.}
  \label{tab:csco_basis}
\end{table}

A sequential measurement of $A$, then $B$, then $C$ will project an arbitrary
initial state $\ket{\psi}$ onto one of these four basis vectors, with
probabilities calculable at each stage. The process demonstrates how introducing
compatible observables resolves spectral degeneracies and allows for the
complete determination of a quantum state.

\section{Time Evolution of the System}

Having fully specified the state of our system through a sequence of
measurements, we now consider its dynamics, governed by the Time-Dependent
Schrödinger Equation (TDSE). For a discrete spectrum and a time-independent
Hamiltonian $H$, the equation and its formal solution are:
$$
i\hbar \frac{d}{dt}\ket{\psi(t)} = H \ket{\psi(t)} \quad \implies \quad
\ket{\psi(t)} = \sum_n e^{-iE_n t/\hbar} \ket{E_n}\braket{E_n}{\psi(0)}
$$
where $\{\ket{E_n}\}$ is the orthonormal basis of energy eigenvectors (autokets)
with corresponding energy eigenvalues $\{E_n\}$.

\subsection{Defining a Hamiltonian from the CSCO}

To proceed, we must define a Hamiltonian for the system. A physically and
algebraically motivated choice is to construct the Hamiltonian from our set of
commuting observables. Since $A$, $B$, and $C$ all commute with each other, any
function of them also commutes. Let us define $H$ as a linear combination of our
CSCO:
$$
H = k_A A + k_B B + k_C C
$$
where $k_A, k_B, k_C \in \mathbb{R}$ are constants that define the energy scale
associated with each observable. This construction guarantees that $H$ is
compatible with $A$, $B$, and $C$, meaning they can all be measured
simultaneously without uncertainty.

\subsection{Energy Spectrum and Eigenstates}

A direct consequence of our construction is that the simultaneous eigenbasis of
the CSCO, which we have painstakingly constructed, is also the eigenbasis of our
Hamiltonian $H$. Let's rename our basis vectors to reflect that they are energy
eigenstates:
\begin{align*}
  \ket{E_1} &:= \ket{c_1} \\
  \ket{E_2} &:= \ket{c_2} \\
  \ket{E_3} &:= \ket{b_3} \\
  \ket{E_4} &:= \ket{4}
\end{align*}
The energy eigenvalue for each state is found by applying $H$ and using the
known eigenvalues of $A$, $B$, and $C$:
\begin{align*}
  H\ket{E_1} &= (k_A\alpha + k_B\gamma + k_C\lambda_1)\ket{E_1} \implies E_1 = k_A\alpha + k_B\gamma + k_C\lambda_1 \\
  H\ket{E_2} &= (k_A\alpha + k_B\gamma + k_C\lambda_2)\ket{E_2} \implies E_2 = k_A\alpha + k_B\gamma + k_C\lambda_2 \\
  H\ket{E_3} &= (k_A\alpha + k_B\delta + k_C \cdot 0)\ket{E_3} \implies E_3 = k_A\alpha + k_B\delta \\
  H\ket{E_4} &= (k_A\beta + k_B\delta + k_C \cdot 0)\ket{E_4} \implies E_4 = k_A\beta + k_B\delta
\end{align*}
By choosing the constants $k_A, k_B, k_C$ appropriately, one can ensure that the
energy spectrum is non-degenerate, with each energy level corresponding to a
unique state vector.

\subsection{General Solution for \texorpdfstring{$\ket{\psi(t)}$}{psi(t)}}

The time evolution of our arbitrary initial state, $\ket{\psi(0)}$, is now
determined. First, we project the initial state onto the energy eigenbasis to
find the expansion coefficients $d_n = \braket{E_n}{\psi(0)}$.
$$
\ket{\psi(0)} = d_1\ket{E_1} + d_2\ket{E_2} + d_3\ket{E_3} + d_4\ket{E_4}
$$
The state at any subsequent time $t$ is then given by evolving each component
with its characteristic complex phase:
$$
\ket{\psi(t)} = d_1 e^{-iE_1 t/\hbar}\ket{E_1} + d_2 e^{-iE_2 t/\hbar}\ket{E_2} + d_3 e^{-iE_3 t/\hbar}\ket{E_3} + d_4 e^{-iE_4 t/\hbar}\ket{E_4}
$$
This expression is the complete solution to the dynamics of the system. It
demonstrates how an initial superposition state evolves as a coherent
``rotation'' in Hilbert space, with each energy eigenstate component acquiring
phase at a rate determined by its energy. This concludes our construction and
analysis of a complete quantum mechanical problem.

\section{Uncertainty Product}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Expectation values of $A$, $B$, and $C$} \\
    The expectation value of an observable $O$ in state $|\psi\rangle$ is defined as
    \[
      \langle O \rangle = \langle \psi | O | \psi \rangle = \sum_i o_i P(o_i),
    \]
    where $o_i$ are the eigenvalues of $O$ and $P(o_i) = |\langle
    o_i|\psi\rangle|^2$ the corresponding probabilities.
    Explicitly,
    \[
      \langle A \rangle = \alpha P(\alpha) + \beta P(\beta), \quad
      \langle B \rangle = \gamma P(\gamma) + \delta P(\delta), \quad
      \langle C \rangle = \lambda_1 P(\lambda_1) + \lambda_2 P(\lambda_2).
    \]

  \item \textbf{Uncertainties} \\
    The variance of an observable $O$ is
    \[
      \Delta O^2 = \langle O^2 \rangle - \langle O \rangle^2,
    \]
    with $\langle O^2 \rangle = \sum_i o_i^2 P(o_i)$. Thus,
    \[
      \Delta A^2 = \alpha^2 P(\alpha) + \beta^2 P(\beta) - \langle A \rangle^2,
    \]
    and similarly for $B$ and $C$.

  \item \textbf{Uncertainty product inequality} \\
    For any two observables $O_1,O_2$, the Robertson relation states:
    \[
      \Delta O_1 \, \Delta O_2 \geq \frac{1}{2}\, \big| \langle [O_1,O_2] \rangle \big|.
    \]

  \item \textbf{Application to the CSCO} \\
    In our construction $[A,B]=[A,C]=[B,C]=0$. Hence,
    \[
      \Delta O_1 \, \Delta O_2 \geq 0,
    \]
    which is always satisfied. The lower bound is trivial in this case.

  \item \textbf{Effect of degeneracy} \\
    The degeneracy of $A$ implies that measuring $A$ may collapse the state only
    into a subspace, not into a unique vector. Consequently, $\Delta A$ can
    vanish while $\Delta B$ or $\Delta C$ remain non-zero, depending on the
    chosen state within the degenerate subspace.

  \item \textbf{Choice of basis within eigenspaces} \\
    Inside a degenerate eigenspace one can freely choose an orthonormal basis.
    Selecting the basis to diagonalize a second observable (e.g. $B$ inside
    $V_\alpha$) minimizes uncertainties for that observable. Different basis
    choices lead to different distributions of probabilities and variances for
    $B$ and $C$.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Verification of Postulates}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Postulate of measurement} \\
    The collapse of the state into an eigenspace of $A$ (e.g. $V_\alpha$) upon
    measurement illustrates the measurement postulate, including the case of
    degenerate spectra.

  \item \textbf{Need for orthonormal bases (Gram--Schmidt)} \\
    Within degenerate subspaces, an orthonormal basis is required to define
    projectors and probabilities consistently. The Gram--Schmidt process
    guarantees the construction of such orthonormal sets.

  \item \textbf{Consistency of probabilities, projectors, and expectation values} \\
    The relations
    \[
      P(o_i) = \langle \psi | P_{o_i} | \psi \rangle, \qquad
      \langle O \rangle = \sum_i o_i P(o_i),
    \]
    demonstrate the internal consistency of the formalism: probabilities,
    projectors, and expectation values are fully compatible and lead to

\subsection*{The Role of Artificial Intelligence as a Computational Collaborator in Quantum Mechanics}

The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the analysis of quantum systems, such
as the one explored in this workshop, redefines the dynamics of learning and
problem-solving, positioning itself as a powerful ``computational
collaborator''. This tool handles the most intensive and error-prone algorithmic
operations, such as matrix diagonalizations, the application of the Gram-Schmidt
orthogonalization process, and the execution of basis changes. By delegating
these tasks to the AI, the student is freed from a significant computational
burden, allowing them to focus on the most fundamental and enriching aspect of
the problem: the physical analysis and mathematical interpretation.

As observed in the exercise, AI is an extremely useful tool for performing
extensive calculations. For instance, constructing the operators B and C in the
computational basis from their eigenvectors is a dense algebraic process that an
AI can execute instantly. However, it is crucial to always keep the purpose of
these procedures in mind. The goal is not merely to obtain a matrix, but to
construct an observable that commutes with the previous ones ($[A,B]=0$,
$[C,A]=[C,B]=0$) in order to lift the degeneracy in a controlled manner. The AI
performs the calculation, but the student must guide the process with a clear
understanding of the physical constraints and mathematical objectives.

This exercise provides a practical illustration of how successive measurements
can define the state of a system. Starting with an observable $A$ with a
degenerate spectrum, a first measurement only allows us to confine the state to
a subspace (in this case, the 3-dimensional $V_{\alpha}$). It is through the
application of additional compatible observables, $B$ and $C$, that the
degeneracy is sequentially broken or ``lifted'', until the system's state is
uniquely determined by a set of eigenvalues ($\alpha, \gamma, \lambda_{1}$),
collapsing to a single eigenvector like $\ket{c_{1}}$.

Furthermore, the development highlights the deep relationship between projection
operators and the calculation of probabilities. The probability of measuring a
specific eigenvalue is calculated by applying the projector associated with its
subspace onto the system's state. For example, $P(\alpha) =
||P_{\alpha}|\psi\rangle||^2$. This connection is not merely computational; it
is a cornerstone of the postulates of quantum mechanics that links the algebraic
structure of observables (through their projectors) with the statistical
outcomes of experiments (the measurement probabilities). The AI can construct
the projector and compute the norm, but interpreting this value as a probability
is a conceptual task that falls entirely on the student.

In conclusion, the synergy between the student and the AI is clear: the AI
serves as the computational engine, while the student acts as the physical
director. The tool accelerates results but does not replace the need for a deep
understanding of quantum postulates, operator theory, and the physical meaning
behind each mathematical step.
